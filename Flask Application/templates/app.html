    <h3>Face Recognition Application</h3>

    <p>
        Gender Classification: This app is driven by a machine 
        learning model. As soon as the user uploads the image, the program 
        converts the image into grayscale, crops the face, converts it into and 
        eigen image, and finally predicts the gender of the person in the image.
        All of this functionality is inside this Flask application.
